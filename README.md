# PSI-ZX-Presentation2024

On 27.6.2024 I gave a 45min presentation about the ZX-Calculus as part of the "Berufsschnuppertag" (two days off from school to experience a career that was able to choose).

If you are interested to learn more about this topic, then you can find the PowerPoint presentation here, as well as further resources.

If after the talk you have any thoughts that you'd like to share with me, then you can contact me by email: `yves.vollmeier.code@gmail.com`.
